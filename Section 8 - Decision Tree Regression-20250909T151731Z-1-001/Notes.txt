116. Step 1a - Decision Tree Regression: Building a Model without Feature Scaling

no need of feature scaling here

same dataset from previous 
exercise 

training DS tree to get the correlation 

DTree is not adapted to simplete datasets like this 

but it will still work on this or even 100's of features 
for DS TREE regression no need of feature scaling 











117. 1b

random forest and dt3 dont need feature scaling because
the splits are being resulted due to the values

120. 

DSTREE does not work well on 2D data like 1 indep var and 1 dep var 
it is well adapted to higher dimensional datasets
