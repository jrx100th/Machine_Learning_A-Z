7. Machine Learning Workflow : Importing, modelling, evaluating your ML model 

3 mean steps

1. Data pre processing
import the data
clean the data 
split into training & test sets 

2. Modelling
Build the model
train the model
make the predictions

3. Evaluation 
calculate performance metrics
make a verdict













8. Data preprocessing : importance of training test split in ML model evaluation 

dataset into training and test set

eg : predicting the sale prices
mileage of car and its are age are given 

bulk of 80% of data is the training set and 
20% will be our testing set











9. Feature Scaling in Machine Learning : Normalization vs Standardisation explained 

feature scaling is applied to columns, not the data in columns
multiple types

1. Normalization

applied to every single column
and results in a new column with new values
in between 0, 1
check in web for the formula


2. Standardisation

all values in between -3 and 3


eg 
1 dataset of 2 columns
birthdate and annual income 


these feature scaling techniques needs to be applied so that we wont end up with biased or non comparable values in the dataset
